Secure Provenance Tracking Filesystem - README
==============================================

Overview
========

The Secure Provenance Tracking Filesystem is a cutting-edge Network File System (NFS) developed in Rust. The filesystem incorporates advanced features to ensure security and provenance tracking. It employs innovative methods such as the Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm, blockchain (Polkadot/Aleph Zero), Redis Cluster, and a Git interception feature to deliver a secure, reliable, and traceable file storage solution.

Features
========

1. Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm:
    - Uses Shamir Secret Sharing to disassemble file contents into secret shares upon creation.
    - Reassembles the secret shares to reconstruct the file contents when the file is read.
    - Enhances security by ensuring that file contents are only accessible when a threshold number of shares are combined.
2. Provenance Tracking with Blockchain:
    - Tracks provenance by recording disassembly and reassembly events on Polkadot/Aleph Zero blockchain.
    - Provides tamper-proof records ensuring the integrity and traceability of file operations.
3. Redis Cluster for Persistence:
    - Utilizes Redis Cluster to store files and directories  persistently.
    - Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
4. Git Interception for Fast Cloning:
    - Enhances the cloning of large Git repositories by utilizing Shamir Secret Sharing.
    - Disassembles repository data into secret shares for faster and secure cloning processes.

Installation
============

Prerequisites
=============

 	- Rust (latest stable version)
 	- Polkadot/Aleph Zero node
  	- Redis Cluster

Steps
=====
1. Clone the Repository:

      `git clone https://github.com/datasignals/secure-provenance-tracking-filesystem.git`<br>
      `cd secure-provenance-tracking-filesystem`

2. Install Dependencies:

      Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use cargo for Rust dependencies.
      - $ `cargo build`

3. Configure Redis Cluster:
      Set up your Redis Cluster with 3 node with ports 6380,6381,6382.
            - Install Redis : 
                  https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/
		- To create redis cluster somewhere in system
			- $ `mkdir Redis Cluster`
			- $ `cd Redis Cluster`
 			- create three files with below config: redis-6380.conf, redis-6381.conf, redis-6382.conf
``` shell
                        # Change port 
                        port 6380 

                        #Expose the port
                        bind 0.0.0.0

                        #Mode
                        protected-mode no

                        # Data directory location
                        dir ./Redis_database/redis-6380

                        # Enable clustering  
                        cluster-enabled yes

                        # Set Password
                        requirepass 0rangerY
```
            - In Redis Cluster folder: 
                  - $ `mkdir Redis_database`
                  - $ `cd Redis_database`
                  - $ `mkdir redis-6380`
                  - $ `mkdir redis-6381`
                  - $ `mkdir redis-6382`
            - To Run Redis Cluster run below commands in 4 different terminals at Redis Cluster folder.
                  $ `redis-server redis-6380.conf`
                  $ `redis-server redis-6381.conf`
                  $ `redis-server redis-6382.conf`
                  $ `redis-cli --cluster create 127.0.0.1:6380 127.0.0.1:6381 127.0.0.1:6382 --cluster-replicas 0 -a 0rangerY --cluster-yes`
                  


4. Configure Blockchain Node:
      Set up your Polkadot/Aleph Zero node following below steps
            $ `git clone https://github.com/datasignals/aleph-node-pinkscorpion.git`
		$ `cd aleph-node-pinkscorpion`
 		$ `cargo build â€”release`
		$ `scripts/run_nodes.sh`

5. Now to Build the filesystem open terminal at secure-provenance-filesystem folder and run:

       `cargo build --bin lockular_nfs --features="demo" --release`

6. Run the FileSystem:
      - Create below folder somewhere in System: 
            $ `mkdir mnt`
            $ `cd mnt`
            $ `mkdir nfs`
      - Now run below comand in terminal at secure-provenance-filesystem folder giving nfs absolute path
            `./target/release/lockular_nfs /mnt/nfs`

7. Mount the FileSystem:
      - Create below folder somewhere in System:
            $ `mkdir mount_point`
            $ `sudo mount_nfs -o nolocks,vers=3,tcp,rsize=131072,actimeo=120,port=2049,mountport=2049 localhost:/  ./mount_point`

8. To run File Sytem Commands
      - $ `cd mount_point`
      - Follow below Basic Commands


Docker Commands
---------------

1. Build the Docker Image:

      `sudo docker build -t lockular_nfs_image .`

2. Run the Docker Image on a docker container:

      `sudo docker run -d --name lockular_nfs_container --privileged --network host lockular_nfs_image`


Usage
=====

Basic Commands
--------------

 - Create a File:<br>
 To create a file, use the standard NFS commands. The filesystem will automatically disassemble the file contents into secret shares.

- Read a File:<br>
To read a file, use the standard NFS commands. The filesystem will reassemble the secret shares to reconstruct the file contents.

Provenance Tracking
-------------------

 - Event Tracking:<br>
   Disassembly and reassembly events are automatically sent to the Polkadot/Aleph Zero blockchain.
    - Use blockchain explorer tools to view the provenance records.

Git Interception
----------------

 - Fast Cloning:  
   The filesystem intercepts Git clone operations to disassemble repository data into secret shares, enhancing the cloning speed and security. Despite continuous disassembly and reassembly, the Git interception feature ensures efficient cloning of git repositories.
    - Clone a repository as usual with Git. The filesystem will handle the disassembly and reassembly processes in the background.

Security
--------

 - Data Security:<br>
   File contents are secured using Shamir Secret Sharing, ensuring that data is split into multiple shares and requires a threshold number of shares to reconstruct.
 - Integrity and Traceability:<br>
   Provenance tracking using blockchain ensures that all file operations are recorded in a tamper-proof manner.
